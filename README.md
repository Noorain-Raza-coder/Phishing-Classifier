# Phishing-Classifier🔍

## Project Description: 👨‍🏫
- Phishing is a common online scam where fake websites trick people into sharing their personal information, like passwords and bank details. Many users fall for these scams because phishing websites look very similar to real ones. Traditional methods to detect phishing often fail because scammers keep changing their tricks.  

- This project aims to build a **machine learning-based web application** that can **automatically detect phishing websites**. The system will learn from real and fake website examples and use important features like website links, features such as URL structure, domain authority, SSL certification, and webpage content characteristics to decide if a site is **safe or dangerous**.  

- Users will be able to upload a csv file of a website URL features into the application, and it will instantly tell them whether the site is **legitimate or a phishing attempt**. This will help protect people from online fraud and keep their personal information safe.
